# ETL Pipeline

## Introduction
The ETL Pipeline project aims to provide an easily configurable and plug-and-play solution for running and integrating new datasets into an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. It simplifies the process of setting up a robust ETL pipeline by utilizing a **run_etl.py** script, which ensures the base architecture and any required Docker containers are efficiently managed and operational.
